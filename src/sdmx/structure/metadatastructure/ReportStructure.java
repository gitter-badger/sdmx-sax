		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>ReportStructure defines a report structure, which comprises a set of metadata attributes that can be defined as a hierarchy, for reporting reference metadata about a target object. The identification of metadata attributes must be unique at any given level of the report structure. Although there are XML schema constraints to help enforce this, these only apply to explicitly assigned identifiers. Identifiers inherited from a concept from which a metadata attribute takes its identity cannot be validated against this constraint. Therefore, systems processing metadata structure definitions will have to perform this check outside of the XML validation.</xs:documentation>
