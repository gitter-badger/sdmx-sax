/**
 *	<xs:simpleType name="ReportingMonthType">
		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>ReportingMonthType defines a time period of 1 month (P1M) in relation to a reporting year which has a start day (day-month) specified in the specialized reporting year start day attribute. In the absence of a start day for the reporting year, a day of January 1 is assumed. In this case a reporting month will coincide with a calendar month. The format of a reporting month is YYYY-Mmm (e.g. 2000-M01), where mm is a two digit month (i.e. 01-12).</xs:documentation>
