			<xs:documentation>ReportingDayType defines a time period of 1 day (P1D) in relation to a reporting year which has a start day (day-month) specified in the specialized reporting year start day attribute. In the absence of a start day for the reporting year, a day of January 1 is assumed. The format of a reporting day is YYYY-Dddd (e.g. 2000-D001), where ddd is a three digit day (i.e. 001-366).</xs:documentation>
