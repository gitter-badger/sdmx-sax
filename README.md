Sdmx Sax Parser

Hi!
This Parser takes (old) Sdmx 2.0 files, and abstracts them to an SDMX 2.1 data model...
of course if your SDMX data service is 2.1 compliant, it should have no problem
understanding the xml documents...

a quickstart document can be found under doc/
example source can be found in the root of the src directory
named 'Example.java'

for comments please email me <jsg at internode.on.net>

SDMX-SAX is now LGPL software
